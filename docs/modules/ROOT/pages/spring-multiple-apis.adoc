= Spring Boot 3 MVC Java Multiple APIs
:oap-spring: https://docs.openapiprocessor.io/spring
:oap-gradle: https://docs.openapiprocessor.io/gradle

This is a very simple Spring Boot 3 (gradle) project in java that is using

* xref:spring::index.adoc[openapi-processor-spring] to generate java interfaces for the api defined in an openapi.yaml file
* xref:gradle::index.adoc[openapi-processor-gradle] plugin to run the spring processor

The purpose of the sample is to show configuration of multiple APIs

== OpenAPI & processor configuration

the `src/api1`  and `src/api2` folders each contain an OpenAPI description and the processor configuration file `mapping.yaml`.

`api1` configures the `enum-type` as `string` with validation. `api2` configures the `enum-type` as `framework` with enum class and converter factory.

== other source files

`src/main` contains the spring boot application class and other classes that are used in the `mapping.yaml` type & annotation mappings.
