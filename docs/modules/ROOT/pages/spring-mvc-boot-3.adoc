= Spring Boot 3 MVC Java Sample
:oap-spring: https://docs.openapiprocessor.io/spring
:oap-gradle: https://docs.openapiprocessor.io/gradle

This is a very simple Spring Boot 3 (gradle) project in java that is using

* xref:spring::index.adoc[openapi-processor-spring] to generate java interfaces for the api defined in an openapi.yaml file
* xref:gradle::index.adoc[openapi-processor-gradle] plugin to run the spring processor

The purpose of the sample is to show the setup of the gradle plugin and the processors. The sample contains a `build.gradle.kts` build file.

== OpenAPI & processor configuration

the `src/api` folder contains an OpenAPI description and the processor configuration file `mapping.yaml`.

The `mapping.yaml` includes a couple of type & annotation mappings which modify the generated code.

== other source files

`src/main` contains the spring boot application class and other classes that are used in the `mapping.yaml` type & annotation mappings.
