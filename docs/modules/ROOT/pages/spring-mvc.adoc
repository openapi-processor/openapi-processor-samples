This is a very simple Spring Boot (gradle & maven) project that is using

* xref:spring::index.adoc[openapi-processor-spring] to generate java interfaces for the api defined in an openapi.yaml file
* xref:json::index.adoc[openapi-processor-json] to convert the openapi yaml to json format
* xref:gradle::index.adoc[openapi-processor-maven] plugin to run both processors

The purpose of the sample is to show the setup of the gradle, the maven plugin and the processors.
