This project is a collection of sample project for openapi-processor which show different configurations of openapi-processor. The code of the samples don't do anything useful.

A few of the examples have a `pom` with the maven plugin, most of the examples use `gradle` (a few have a  groovy dsl `build.grade`, most have a kotlin dsl `build.gradle.kts`).

the name of the example project gives a hint which feature (configuration) and framework is showcased in the example. Most simply use java, the newer examples usually use kotlin.
