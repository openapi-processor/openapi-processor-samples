This is a very simple Spring Boot (gradle) project that is using

* xref:spring::index.adoc[openapi-processor-spring] as annotation processor to generate java interfaces for the api defined in an openapi.yaml file

The purpose of the sample is to show the setup of gradle with the annotation processor.


== Running with gradle

Clone the project from link:{oap-github}[GitHub], navigate into the project root folder `samples/spring-mvc-ap` and run

----
 ../../gradlew bootRun
----

to start the sample application.


== Sample Endpoints

the sample has a few simple endpoints described with OpenAPI in `src/api`. With IDEA you can call the endpoints by running the requests from the `requests.http` file.

=== ping

    curl http://localhost:8080/ping

=== echo

    curl http://localhost:8080/echo?source=foo
